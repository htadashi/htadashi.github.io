Welcome to my personal web page.

I am a researcher with a PhD in Control Theory. My research interests include optimization, control theory, and machine learning.

In addition to my research, I am a software developer with extensive experience in building and auditing Ethereum smart contracts.

I am also a technical writer, skilled in creating comprehensive documentation for large codebases and writing fun posts for blogs/podcasts.
