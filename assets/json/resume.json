When the lemma is applied to parameter-dependent LMIs, as such those that arise from problems of robust stability, the extra variables introduced by this lemma also become dependent on this parameter. This technical note presents some sufficient conditions which ensure, without losing generality, that these extra variables can assume a simple functional dependence on the parameters as continuity or even independence. The results allow avoiding an unnecessary use of a more functionally complicated parameter-dependent variable that increases the search computational burden without reducing the conservatism of the solution.","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7878619/"},{"name":"Dual quaternion-based bimodal global control for robust rigid body pose kinematic stabilization","publisher":"Proceedings of 2017 American Control Conference","releaseDate":"2017-12-31","summary":"A hybrid bimodal controller for rigid body pose stabilization within the group of unit norm dual-quaternions is proposed in this paper. Using two binary logic state variables, this hysteresis-based controller represents a middle term solution between the memoryless discontinuous controller and the fixed-width hysteretic one. The proposed strategy is novel within the dual-quaternions framework and addresses three common difficulties that appears in the literature of pose and attitude stabilization: global stability, robustness against chattering and against unwinding. The efficacy and performance of the proposed controller are illustrated with numerical examples.","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7963117/"},{"name":"Hybrid Kinematic Control for Rigid Body Pose Stabilization using Dual Quaternions","publisher":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","releaseDate":"2017-12-31","summary":"In this paper, we address the rigid body pose stabilization problem using dual quaternion formalism. We propose a hybrid control strategy to design a switching control law with hysteresis in such a way that the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed and such that the global attractivity of the stabilization pose does not exhibit chattering, a problem that is present in all discontinuous-based feedback controllers. Using numerical simulations, we illustrate the problems that arise from existing results in the literature—as unwinding and chattering—and verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller to solve the robust global pose stability problem.","url":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016003217300522"},{"name":"Parameter-Dependent Filter with Finite Time Boundedness Property for Continuous-Time LPV Systems","publisher":"Proceedings of XVII Latin American Conference on Automatic Control","releaseDate":"2016-12-31","summary":"","url":"http://www.eafit.edu.co/clca-2016"},{"name":"A new condition for finite time boundedness analysis","publisher":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","releaseDate":"2015-12-31","summary":"In this paper, a new condition for finite time boundedness analysis is presented.

Although there are several variants of this lemma, it can be summarized as an equivalence of a quadratic inequality with a linear constraint to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) with possibly more extra variables than the original problem. When applying Finsler's lemma to problems that depends of a parameter, the extra variables stemming from the use of Finsler's lemma can also be dependent of this parameter. In this paper it is investigated when these extra variables can assume a simple structure without loss of generality and some sufficient conditions that guarantees this assumption are given. These sufficient conditions can be applied when investigating parameter dependent LMIs that emerge, for instance, when dealing with the robust stability of systems with polytopic uncertainty.","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7403370/"},{"name":"Finite time robust filtering for time-varying uncertain polytopic linear systems","publisher":"Proceedings of the 2013 European Control Conference","releaseDate":"2013-12-31","summary":"In this paper, the problem of robust filter design for uncertain continuous-time systems is investigated in the context of finite time stability.
